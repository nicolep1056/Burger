# Bob's Burger Specials!
A Pun-derful Burger Application

## Description

The user creates burger specials to add to the menu. This also adds the new burger entry to the MySQL database. The special will then be added as available on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then eat any burger special by clicking "devour it", which moves it into the adjacent column and updates its status accordingly in the database. If they want a special out of the rotation, they may delete it by clicking "toss it".
